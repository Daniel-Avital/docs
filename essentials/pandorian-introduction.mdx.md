# Introduction

## Welcome to Pandorian

Code is being written at the speed of AI. As your team leverages AI coding tools to move faster than ever, maintaining your organization's engineering culture, norms, and best practices becomes increasingly critical—and increasingly difficult.

Pandorian is an AI Code Enforcer that gives you, the engineering leader, comprehensive and intuitive control. Instead of configuring complex static analysis tools or scaling yourself through endless code reviews, you write guidelines in plain English and Pandorian automatically enforces your organization's standards system-wide, across every repository and every line of code.

## Why Pandorian Exists

As engineering organizations scale, maintaining consistent code standards becomes increasingly difficult. Teams face:

- **Code review bottlenecks** where the same issues appear repeatedly
- **Knowledge fragmentation** where best practices live in people's heads, Slack threads, or outdated wikis
- **Tool sprawl** with dozens of linters and analyzers, each requiring specialized configuration
- **Enforcement gaps** where standards exist but aren't consistently applied

Traditional static analysis tools help, but they require deep expertise to configure and can't capture your organization's specific architectural decisions, security requirements, or domain logic. Pandorian fills this gap by making enforcement as intuitive as writing documentation.

## Who Pandorian is For

Pandorian is built for **engineering leaders who want to scale their impact**:

- **VPs of Engineering** who need to enforce standards across multiple teams and codebases
- **Engineering Managers** responsible for code quality and team productivity
- **Tech Leads** who want to scale their architectural knowledge beyond code reviews
- **Growing teams** where manual enforcement through code reviews alone doesn't scale

Whether you're a startup establishing your first engineering standards or an enterprise maintaining consistency across hundreds of developers, if your team repeatedly catches the same issues in code review, if onboarding takes weeks because standards aren't documented, or if you're struggling to maintain consistency across your codebase—Pandorian was built for you.

## How It Works

Pandorian makes enforcement intuitive:

**1. Write Guidelines in Plain English**

Describe what you want in natural language. No complex rule syntax or programming required.

*"Configuration values must be externalized rather than hardcoded in source code."*

**2. Run Scans Automatically**

Pandorian scans your repositories on every pull request, catching violations before they reach production. Full repository scans give you a comprehensive view of your codebase health.

**3. Fix with Context-Aware Guidance**

When violations are found, Pandorian provides detailed context and can generate markdown instructions you can feed directly to AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Claude for automated fixes.

## What Makes Pandorian Different

**Enforcement layer, not a code writing or review tool:** Sits above CI/CD to catch what other tools miss—Pandorian doesn't write code or replace reviews, it enforces your standards systematically

**Handles complex, robust engineering guidelines:** Not just simplistic syntax rules—capture your organization's architectural decisions, business logic requirements, and domain-specific best practices

**Plain English guidelines:** Create your own custom guidelines or choose from our catalog. No specialized query languages or rule syntax to learn

**Language agnostic:** Works across your entire tech stack without per-language configuration

**Stack agnostic:** Whether your team uses Cursor, Windsurf, manual reviews, or AI review tools—Pandorian is agnostic to who or what is writing the code
